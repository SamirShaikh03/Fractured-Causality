## 📖 About

**Fractured Causality** is an innovative puzzle-adventure game that challenges your understanding of cause and effect across parallel dimensions. Built entirely with Python and Pygame, this project showcases advanced game development concepts including event-driven architecture, causal graph systems, and complex state management.

### 🎭 The Story

You are **The Archivist**, a being who exists outside the constraints of normal causality. Blessed—or cursed—with the ability to traverse parallel universes at will, you witness how reality fractures and reforms with each choice made.

But power comes with consequences. Every action you take in one universe creates ripples across all timelines. Kill an enemy in the **Prime** universe, and their echo might vanish from **Echo**—or grow stronger in **Fracture**. Destroy an object here, and its causal descendants cease to exist there.

**Your mission:** Navigate through three increasingly complex levels, solve causal puzzles that span multiple realities, and reach the exit portal before the paradox you generate collapses all of existence.

> *Break causality. Solve the impossible. Don't collapse the multiverse.*

## 🎮 Gameplay

### Core Mechanics

#### **Universe Switching**
Press **SPACE** to cycle through three parallel universes. Each universe has different entity configurations, but all are causally connected. Watch for the colored border that indicates your current reality.

#### **Causal Relationships**
Entities can have causal dependencies:
- **Parent → Child**: If the parent is destroyed, the child ceases to exist
- **Mirrored States**: Some entities share states across universes
- **Conditional Existence**: Doors that only open when keys are collected

Use **TAB** to toggle **Causal Sight** and visualize these connections as glowing lines between entities.

#### **Paradox System**
Every action that breaks causality generates paradox:
- **Low Paradox (0-30%)**: Stable - Safe to continue
- **Moderate Paradox (30-60%)**: Unstable - Visual distortions appear
- **High Paradox (60-85%)**: Critical - Reality begins glitching
- **Extreme Paradox (85-100%)**: Collapse - **GAME OVER**

Some puzzles require generating paradox to progress, but manage it carefully!

### Puzzle Examples

**Level 1 - The Basics:**
- Learn universe switching
- Collect keys in one universe to unlock doors in another
- Understand basic causal relationships

**Level 2 - Bridges and Echoes:**
- Use Echo Switches to build bridges between universes
- Navigate complex causal chains
- Manage multiple keys and variant doors

**Level 3 - The Ancient Tree:**
- Destroy a tree in one universe to remove Shades in another
- Master paradox management
- Solve multi-step causal puzzles

## 🎹 Controls

### Movement & Interaction

| Key | Action | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| **W A S D** | Move | Navigate in all four directions |
| **Arrow Keys** | Move | Alternative movement controls |
| **E** | Interact | Pick up keys, use doors, activate objects |
| **SPACE** | Switch Universe | Cycle through Prime → Echo → Fracture |
| **TAB** | Causal Sight | Toggle visualization of entity connections |
| **ESC** | Pause | Open pause menu |

### Menu Navigation

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|

| **ESC** | Go back / Resume game |

### Tips

- 💡 **Stuck on a puzzle?** Try switching universes—paths that are blocked in one reality might be open in another.
- 🔍 **Use Causal Sight often** to understand which entities depend on each other.
- ⚠️ **Watch your paradox meter** at the top of the screen—too much paradox means game over!
- 🗝️ **Keys persist across universes**, so collect them strategically.
